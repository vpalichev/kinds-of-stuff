Free or Near-Free Publicly Available Online LLMs (as of December 2025)
Based on the latest data, here's a curated list of publicly accessible online Large Language Models (LLMs) that are completely free or near-free (e.g., generous free tiers with optional paid upgrades for higher limits). These are web-based interfaces or APIs where you can interact directly via a browser or simple API calls—no downloads or complex setups required. I've focused on reliable, high-quality options suitable for chatting, coding, research, or general tasks. All are accessible without upfront payment, though some may require a free account signup.
I've organized them into a table for easy comparison, including key features, limitations, and access links. "Free Tier Limits" indicate typical daily/monthly caps; these can vary by usage.

Quick Notes:

Completely Free: All listed options have no-cost entry points with no credit card required. "Near-free" ones (e.g., Perplexity's Pro searches) offer unlimited basics but tease upgrades.
API Access for Devs: For programmatic use, check free tiers from Groq (ultra-fast inference), Together AI ($25 credits), OpenRouter (unified free models), or Google AI Studio (1M tokens/min). These are great for building apps without paying initially.
Playgrounds for Testing: Try multiple models side-by-side on LMSYS Chatbot Arena or Hugging Face Spaces—both fully free and no signup needed.
Limitations & Tips: Free tiers often have rate limits to prevent abuse; use during off-peak hours. For privacy, avoid sharing sensitive data. If you need more power, most upgrade paths start at ~$20/month.
